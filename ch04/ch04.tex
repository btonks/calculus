\section{Newton's method}\label{sec:newtons-method}\index{Newton's method}

In the 1958 science fiction novel \textbf{Have Space Suit --- Will Travel}, by
Robert Heinlein, Kip is a high school student who wants to be an engineer,
and his father is trying to convince him to stretch himself more if he
wants to get anything out of his education:

\newcommand{\quoted}[1]{\textit{#1}}

\quoted{``Why did Van Buren fail of re-election? How do you extract the cube
root of eighty-seven?''}

\quoted{Van Buren had been a president; that was all I remembered. But I could
answer the other one. ``If you want a cube root, you look in a table
in the back of the book.''}

\quoted{Dad sighed. ``Kip, do you think that table was brought down from on
high by an archangel?''}

We no longer use tables to compute roots, but how does a pocket calculator
do it? A technique called Newton's method allows us to calculate
the inverse of any function efficiently, including cases that aren't
preprogrammed into a calculator. In the example from the novel,
we know how to calculate the function $y=x^3$ fairly accurately and
quickly for any given value of $x$, but we want to turn the equation
around and find $x$ when $y=87$. We start with a rough mental guess:
since $4^3=64$ is a little too small, and $5^3=125$ is much too big,
we guess $x\approx 4.3$. Testing our guess, we have
$4.3^3=79.5$. We want $y$ to get bigger by $7.5$, and we can use
calculus to find approximately how much bigger $x$ needs to get
in order to accomplish that:
\begin{align*}
  \Delta x &= \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y} \Delta y \\
           &\approx \frac{\der x}{\der y} \Delta y \\
           &= \frac{\Delta y}{\der y/\der x} \\
           &= \frac{\Delta y}{3x^2} \\
           &= \frac{\Delta y}{3x^2} \\
           &= 0.14
\end{align*}
Increasing our value of $x$ to $4.3+0.14=4.44$, we find that 
$4.44^3=87.5$ is a pretty good approximation to 87. If we need higher
precision, we can go through the process again with $\Delta y=-0.5$,
giving
\begin{align*}
  \Delta x &\approx \frac{\Delta y}{3x^2} \\
           &= 0.14 \\
  x &= 4.43 \\
  x^3 &= 86.9 \qquad .
\end{align*}
This second iteration gives an excellent approximation.

\fig{keplerian}{Example \ref{eg:keplerian}.}

\begin{eg}\label{eg:keplerian}
\egquestion Figure \ref{eg:keplerian} shows the astronomer Johannes Kepler's\index{Kepler, Johannes}\index{planets, motion of} analysis
of the motion of the planets. The ellipse is the orbit of the planet around
the sun. At $t=0$, the planet is at its closest approach to the sun, A. At some
later time, the planet is at point B. The angle $x$ (measured in radians) is defined with reference
to the imaginary circle encompassing the orbit. Kepler found the equation
\begin{equation*}
  2\pi \frac{t}{T} = x-e\sin x \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where the period, $T$, is the time required for the planet to complete a full orbit, and
the eccentricity of the ellipse, $e$, is a number that measures how much it
differs from a circle. The relationship is complicated because the planet
speeds up as it falls inward toward the sun, and slows down again as it swings
back away from it.

The planet Mercury has $e=0.206$. Find the angle $x$
when Mercury has completed $1/4$ of a period.

\eganswer We have
\begin{equation*}
  y = x-(0.206)\sin x \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
and we want to find $x$ when $y=2\pi/4=1.57$. As a first guess, we try $x=\pi/2$ (90 degrees), since the eccentricity of Mercury's
orbit is actually much smaller than the example shown in the figure, and
therefore the planet's speed doesn't vary all that much as it goes around the sun.
For this value of $x$ we have $y=1.36$, which is too small by $0.21$.
\begin{align*}
  \Delta x &\approx \frac{\Delta y}{\der y/\der x} \\
           &= \frac{0.21}{1-(0.206)\cos x} \\
           &= 0.21
\end{align*}
(The derivative $\der y/\der x$ happens to be 1 at $x=\pi/2$.) This gives a new value of $x$, 1.57+.21=1.78.
Testing it, we have $y=1.58$, which is correct to within rounding errors after only one iteration.
(We were only supplied with a value of $e$ accurate to three significant figures, so we can't get a result
with precision better than about that level.)
\end{eg}

\section{Implicit differentiation}\index{implicit differentiation}\index{differentiation!implicit}

We can differentiate any function that is written as a formula,
and find a result in terms of a formula. However, sometimes the
original problem can't be written in any nice way as a formula.
For example, suppose we want to find $\der y/\der x$ in a case
where the relationship between $x$
and $y$ is given by the following equation:
\begin{equation*}
  y^7+y = x^7+x^2 \qquad .
\end{equation*}
There is no equivalent of the quadratic formula for seventh-order
polynomials, so we have no way to solve for one variable in terms
of the other in order to differentiate it. However, we can still
find $\der y/\der x$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. Suppose we let $x$
grow to $x+\der x$. Then for example the $x^2$ term will grow
to $(x+\der x)^2=x+2\der x+\der x^2$. The squared infinitesimal
is negligible, so the increase in $x^2$ was really just
$2\der x$, and we've really just computed the derivative of
$x^2$ with respect to $x$ and multiplied it by $\der x$. In
symbols,
\begin{align*}
  \der(x^2) &= \frac{\der(x^2)}{\der x} \cdot \der x \\
           &= 2x \: \der x \qquad .
\end{align*}
That is, the change in $x^2$ is $2x$ times the change in $x$.
Doing this to both sides of the original equation, we have
\begin{gather*}
  \der(y^7+y) = \der(x^7+x^2)\\
  7y^6\:\der y + 1\:\der y = 7x^6\:\der x + 2x\:\der x\\
  (7y^6+1)\der y = (7x^6+2x)\der x \\
  \frac{\der y}{\der x} = \frac{7x^6+2x}{7y^6+1} \qquad .
\end{gather*}
This still doesn't give us a formula for the derivative in
terms of $x$ alone, but it's not entirely useless. For instance,
if we're given a numerical value of $x$, we can always use
Newton's method to find $y$, and then
evaluate the derivative.

\section{Methods of integration}

\subsection{Change of variable}\index{integration!methods of!change of variable}

Sometimes and unfamiliar-looking integral can be made into a familiar one by substituting a
a new variable for an old one. For example, we know how to integrate $1/x$ --- the answer
is $\ln x$ --- but what about
\begin{equation*}
  \int \frac{\der x}{2x+1}   \qquad ?
\end{equation*}
Let $u=2x+1$. Differentiating both sides, we have $\der u=2\der x$, or $\der x=\der u/2$, so
\begin{align*}
  \int \frac{\der x}{2x+1}   &= \int \frac{\der u/2}{u} \\
       &= \frac{1}{2}\ln u + c \\
       &= \frac{1}{2}\ln(2x+1) +c \qquad .
\end{align*}

In the case of a definite integral, we have to remember to change the limits of integration
to reflect the new variable.

\begin{eg}
\egquestion Evaluate $\int_3^4 \der x/(2x+1)$.

\eganswer As before, let $u=2x+1$.
\begin{align*}
  \int_{x=3}^{x=4} \frac{\der x}{2x+1}   &= \int_{u=7}^{u=9} \frac{\der u/2}{u} \\
       &= \left.\frac{1}{2}\ln u\right|_{u=7}^{u=9} \\
\intertext{Here the notation $\left.\right|_{u=7}^{u=9}$ means to evaluate the function at
7 and 9, and subtract the former from the latter. The result is}
  \int_{x=3}^{x=4} \frac{\der x}{2x+1}  &= \frac{1}{2}(\ln 9-\ln 7) \\
            &=\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{9}{7} \qquad .
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

Sometimes, as in the next example, a clever substitution is the secret to doing a
seemingly impossible integral.

\begin{eg}\label{eg:not-so-tricky}
\egquestion Evaluate
\begin{equation*}
  \int \frac{e^{\sqrt x}}{\sqrt x} \der x \qquad .
\end{equation*}

\eganswer The only hope for reducing this to a form we can do is to let
$u=\sqrt x$. Then $\der x=\der(u^2)=2u\der u$, so
\begin{align*}
  \int \frac{e^{\sqrt x}}{\sqrt x} \der x &=   \int \frac{e^u}{u} \cdot 2u\:\der u \\
             &= 2 \int e^u \der u \\
             &= 2e^u \\
             &= 2e^{\sqrt{x}} \qquad .
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

Example \ref{eg:not-so-tricky} really isn't so tricky, since there was only one logical
choice for the substitution that had any hope of working. The following is a little more
dastardly.

\begin{eg}\label{eg:arctan}\index{arctangent}
\egquestion Evaluate
\begin{equation*}
  \int \frac{\der x}{1+x^2} \qquad .
\end{equation*}

\eganswer The substitution that works is $x=\tan u$. First let's see what this does
to the expression $1+x^2$. The familiar identity
\begin{align*}
   &\sin^2 u + \cos^2 u = 1 \qquad ,\\
\intertext{when divided by $\cos^2 u$, gives}
   &\tan^2 u + 1 = \sec^2 u \qquad ,
\end{align*}
so $1+x^2$ becomes $\sec^2 u$.
But differentiating both sides of $x=\tan u$ gives
\begin{align*}
  \der x &= \der \left[\sin u(\cos u)^{-1}\right] \\
         &= (\der\sin u)(\cos u)^{-1}\\
         &  \quad +(\sin u)\der\left[(\cos u)^{-1}\right] \\
         &= \left(1+\tan^2 u\right)\der u \\
         &= \sec^2 u\:\der u \qquad , 
\end{align*}
so the integral becomes
\begin{align*}
  \int \frac{\der x}{1+x^2} &= \int \frac{\sec^2 u \der u}{\sec^2 u} \\
           &= u+c \\
           &= \tan^{-1} x+c \qquad .
\end{align*}
\end{eg}
%
What mere mortal would ever have suspected that the substitution $x=\tan u$ was
the one that was needed in example \ref{eg:arctan}? One possible answer is to
give up and do the integral on a computer:

\begin{Code}
  \ii Integrate(x) 1/(1+x^2)
  \oo{ArcTan(x)}
\end{Code}

Another possible answer is that you can usually smell the possibility of
this type of substitution, involving a trig function, when the thing to be
integrated contains something reminiscent of the Pythagorean theorem, as
suggested by figure \figref{tan-substitution}. The $1+x^2$ looks like what
you'd get if you had a right triangle with legs 1 and $x$, and were using the
Pythagorean theorem to find its hypotenuse.
%
\smallfig{tan-substitution}{The substitution $x=\tan u$.}

\begin{eg}
\egquestion Evaluate $\int \der x/\sqrt{1-x^2}$.

\eganswer The $\sqrt{1-x^2}$ looks like what you'd get if you had a right
triangle with hypotenuse 1 and a leg of length $x$, and were using the
Pythagorean theorem to find the other leg, as in figure \figref{cos-substitution}.
This motivates us to try the substitution $x=\cos u$, which gives
$\der x=-\sin u\:\der u$ and $\sqrt{1-x^2}=\sqrt{1-\cos^2u}=\sin u$. The result is
\begin{align*}
  \int \frac{\der x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} &= \int \frac{-\sin u\:\der u}{\sin u} \\
                 &= u+c \\
                 &= \cos^{-1}x \qquad .
\end{align*}
\end{eg}
%
\smallfig{cos-substitution}{The substitution $x=\cos u$.}

\subsection{Integration by parts}\index{integration!methods of!by parts}

Figure \figref{by-parts} shows a technique called integration by parts.
If the integral $\int v\der u$ is easier than the integral $\int u\der v$,
then we can calculate the easier one, and then by simple geometry determine
the one we wanted. Identifying the large rectangle that surrounds both
shaded areas, and the small white rectangle on the lower left, we have
\begin{align*}
  \int u\:\der v =& (\text{area of large rectangle})\\
                &-(\text{area of small rectangle})\\
                &\int v\:\der u \qquad .
\end{align*}

\fig{by-parts}{Integration by parts.}

In the case of an indefinite integral, we have a similar relationship
derived from the product rule:
\begin{gather*}
  \:\der(uv) = u \:\der v + v \:\der u \\
  u \:\der v = \der(uv) - v \:\der u \\
\end{gather*}
Integrating both sides, we have the following relation.
\begin{important}[Integration by parts]
\begin{equation*}
  \int u \:\der v = uv - \int v \:\der u \qquad .
\end{equation*}
\end{important}
Since a definite integral can always be done by evaluating an indefinite
integral at its upper and lower limits, one usually uses this form.
Integrals don't usually come prepackaged in a form that makes it
obvious that you should use integration by parts. What the equation for
integration by parts tells us is that if we can split up the integrand
into two factors, one of which (the $\der v$) we know how to integrate, we have
the option of changing the integral into a new form in which that factor
becomes its integral, and the other factor becomes its derivative. If we
choose the right way of splitting up the integrand into parts, the result can be
a simplification.

\begin{eg}
\egquestion Evaluate
\begin{equation*}
  \int x \cos x \:\der x
\end{equation*}

\egquestion There are two obvious possibilities for splitting up the integrand
into factors,
\begin{align*}
  u \:\der v &= (x)(\cos x\:\der x) \\
\intertext{or}
  u \:\der v &= (\cos x)(x\:\der x) \qquad .
\end{align*}
The first one is the one that lets us make progress. If $u=x$, then
$\der u=\der x$, and if $\der v=\cos x\:\der x$, then integration
gives $v=\sin x$.
\begin{align*}
  \int x \cos x \:\der x &= \int u \:\der v \\
                       &= uv - \int v \:\der u \\
                       &= x\sin x-\int \sin x \:\der x \\
                       &= x\sin x+\cos x
\end{align*}
Of the two possibilities we considered for $u$ and $\der v$, the reason
this one helped was that differentiating $x$ gave $\der x$, which was
simpler, and integrating $\cos x\der x$ gave $\sin x$, which was no
more complicated than before. The second possibility would have made
things worse rather than better, because integrating $x\der x$ would
have given $x^2/2$, which would have been more complicated rather than
less.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
\egquestion Evaluate $\int \ln x \:\der x$.

\eganswer This one is a little tricky, because it isn't explicitly
written as a product, and yet we can attack it using integration by
parts. Let $u=\ln x$ and $\der v=\der x$.
\begin{align*}
  \int \ln x \:\der x &= \int u \:\der v \\
                       &= uv - \int v \:\der u \\
                       &= x\ln x-\int x \frac{\der x}{x} \\
                       &= x\ln x-x
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

\subsection{Partial fractions}\index{integration!methods of!partial fractions}\index{partial fractions}

Given a function like
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{-1}{x-1}+\frac{1}{x+1} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
we can rewrite it over a common denominator like this:
\begin{align*}
  &\left(\frac{-1}{x-1}\right)\left(\frac{x+1}{x+1}\right) \\
  &+\left(\frac{1}{x+1}\right)\left(\frac{x-1}{x-1}\right) \\
  &=\frac{-x-1+x-1}{(x-1)(x+1)} \\
  &=\frac{-2}{x^2-1} \qquad .
\end{align*}
But note that the original form is easily integrated to give
\begin{multline*}
  \int \left(\frac{-1}{x-1}+\frac{1}{x+1}\right)\:\der x \\
    =-\ln(x-1)+\ln(x+1)+c \qquad ,
\end{multline*}
while faced with the form \linebreak[4] $-2/(x^2-1)$, we wouldn't have known how to
integrate it.

The idea of the method of partial fractions is that if we want to
do an integral of the form
\begin{equation*}
  \int \frac{\der x}{P(x)} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $P(x)$ is an nth order polynomial, we can always rewrite $1/P$ as
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{P(x)} = \frac{A_1}{x-r_1} + \ldots \frac{A_n}{x-r_n} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $r_1$ \ldots $r_n$ are the roots of the polynomial, i.e., the
solutions of the equation $P(r)=0$. If the polynomial is second-order,
you can find the roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ using the quadratic formula; I'll assume for
the time being that they're real.
For higher-order polynomials, there is no surefire, easy
way of finding the roots by hand, and you'd be smart simply to use computer software
to do it. In Yacas, you can find the real roots of a polynomial like this:

\begin{Code}
  \ii FindRealRoots(x^4-5*x^3
  \ii    -25*x^2+65*x+84)
  \oo{\{3.,7.,-4.,-1.\}}
\end{Code}

(I assume it uses Newton's method to find them.) The constants
$A_i$ can then be determined by algebra, or by the trick of evaluating
$1/P(x)$ for a value of $x$ very close to one of the roots.
In the example of the polynomial 
$x^4-5x^3-25x^2+65x+84$, let $r_1$ \ldots $r_4$ be the roots in the
order in which they were returned by Yacas. Then $A_1$ can be
found by evaluating $1/P(x)$ at $x=3.000001$:

\begin{Code}
  \ii P(x):=x^4-5*x^3-25*x^2
  \ii   +65*x+84
  \ii N(1/P(3.000001))
  \oo{-8928.5702094768}
\end{Code}

We know that for $x$ very close to 3, the expression
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{P} = \frac{A_1}{x-3}+\frac{A_2}{x-7}+\frac{A_3}{x+4}+\frac{A_4}{x+1}
\end{equation*}
will be dominated by the $A_1$ term, so
\begin{gather*}
  -8930 \approx \frac{A_1}{3.000001-3} \\
  A_1 \approx (-8930)(10^{-6})  \qquad .
\end{gather*}
By the same method we can find the other four constants:
\begin{Code}
  \ii dx:=.000001
  \ii N(1/P(7+dx),30)*dx
  \oo{0.2840908276e-2}
  \ii N(1/P(-4+dx),30)*dx
  \oo{-0.4329006192e-2}
  \ii N(1/P(-1+dx),30)*dx
  \oo{0.1041666664e-1}
\end{Code}
(The \verb@N( ,30)@ construct is to tell Yacas to do a numerical calculation rather than an exact
symbolic one, and to use 30 digits of precision, in order to
avoid problems with rounding errors.) Thus, \begin{align*}
  \frac{1}{P} &= \frac{-8.93\times10^{-3}}{x-3} \\
              &+ \frac{2.84\times10^{-3}}{x-7} \\
              &- \frac{4.33\times10^{-3}}{x+4} \\
              &+ \frac{1.04\times10^{-2}}{x+1} \qquad .
\end{align*}
The desired integral is
\begin{align*}
  \int \frac{\der x}{P(x)} &= -8.93\times10^{-3}\ln(x-3) \\
              & +2.84\times10^{-3}\ln(x-7) \\
              & -4.33\times10^{-3}\ln(x+4) \\
              &+ 1.04\times10^{-2}\ln(x+1) \\
              &+c \qquad .
\end{align*}

There are some possible complications:
(1) The same factor may occur more than once, as in
$x^3-5x^2+7x-3=(x-1)(x-1)(x-3)$. In this example, we have to look for an answer of the form
$A/(x-1)+B/(x-1)^2+C/(x-3)$, the solution being
$-.25/(x-1)-.5/(x-1)^2+.25/(x-3)$.
(2) The roots may be complex. 
This is no show-stopper
if you're using computer software that handles complex numbers gracefully. (You can choose a $c$
that makes the result real.) 
In fact, as discussed in section \ref{sec:complex-part-frac}, some beautiful things can happen
with complex roots. But as an alternative,
any polynomial with real coefficients can be factored into linear
and quadratic factors with real coefficients. For each quadratic factor $Q(x)$, we then have a
partial fraction of the form $(A+Bx)/Q(x)$, where $A$ and $B$ can be determined by algebra.
In Yacas, this can be done using the \verb@Apart@ function.

\begin{eg}
\egquestion Evaluate the integral
\begin{equation*}
  \int \frac{\der x}{(x^4-8*x^3+8*x^2-8*x+7}
\end{equation*}
using the method of partial fractions.

\eganswer First we use Yacas to look for real roots of the polynomial:

\begin{Code}
  \ii FindRealRoots(x^4-8*x^3
  \ii   +8*x^2-8*x+7)
  \oo{\{1.,7.\}}
\end{Code}

Unfortunately this polynomial seems to have only two real roots; the rest
are complex.
We can divide out the factor $(x-1)(x-7)$, but that still
leaves us with a second-order polynomial, which has no real roots.
One approach would be to factor the polynomial into the form
$(x-1)(x-7)(x-p)(x-q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are complex,
as in section \ref{sec:complex-part-frac}. Instead, let's use
Yacas to expand the integrand in terms of partial fractions:

\begin{Code}
  \ii Apart(1/(x^4-8*x^3
  \ii   +8*x^2-8*x+7))
  \oo{((2*x)/25+3/50)/(x^2+1)}
  \oo{  +1/(300*(x-7))}
  \oo{  +(-1)/(12*(x-1))}
\end{Code}

We can now rewrite the integral like this:

\begin{align*}
   &\frac{2}{25} \int \frac{x\:\der x}{x^2+1} \\
  +&\frac{3}{50} \int \frac{\der x}{x^2+1} \\
  +&\frac{1}{300} \int \frac{\der x}{x-7} \\
  -&\frac{1}{12} \int \frac{\der x}{x-1} \\
\intertext{which we can evaluate as follows:}
  & \frac{1}{25} \ln(x^2+1) \\
  +&\frac{3}{50} \tan^{-1}x \\
  +&\frac{1}{300} \ln(x-7) \\
  -&\frac{1}{12} \ln(x-1) \\
  +&c
\end{align*}

In fact, Yacas should be able to do the whole integral for us from scratch, but
it's best to understand how these things work under the hood, and to avoid
being completely dependent on one particular piece of software. As an illustration
of this gem of wisdom, I found that when I tried to make Yacas evaluate the
integral in one gulp, it choked because the calculation became too complicated!
Because I understood the ideas behind the procedure, I was still able to
get a result through a mixture of computer calculations and working it by hand.
Someone who didn't have the knowledge of the technique might have tried
the integral using the software, seen it fail, and concluded, incorrectly,
that the integral was one that simply couldn't be done. A computer is
no substitute for understanding.
